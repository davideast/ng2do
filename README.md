# Angular 2 Todo App

Angular 2 is not packaged or ready for production... but this is a todo app with it.

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/davideast/ng2do.git
cd ng2do
npm install -g gulp # Not required if you already have gulp installed globally
npm install
gulp
gulp serve
```

### How the installation works

The installation clones the [Angular 2 quickstart](https://github.com/angular/quickstart) which contains Angular and all of the dependencies to transpile from AtScript/TypeScript. The local .git folder for the quickstart is removed automatically.

### AngularFire?

The AngularFire included in this project is not a final or working version of AngularFire for Angular 2.
